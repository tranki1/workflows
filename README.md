Developing an efficient workflow will help you write better code and test and deploy your web applications easily and efficiently. This showcase to illustrate how to generate a workflow that makes it easier to build websites with processed languages like Sass, Compass, and CoffeeScript; how to automate development and production versions of the sites, track and share project files with Git and GitHub, and add libraries like jQuery and Mustache.js with Browserify.
